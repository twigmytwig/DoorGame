# Game Idea

## Core Rule
No art, only ASCII.

## Concept
A door-choosing game where you progress through rooms by selecting doors. Once you enter a room, there's no going back—only forward.

## Gameplay Loop
1. Player enters a room
2. Room presents multiple doors to choose from
3. Player picks a door
4. New room grants a benefit or inflicts a penalty
5. Repeat

## Room Effects
Rooms can:
- Grant buffs (health, power, speed, etc.)
- Deal damage or apply debuffs
- Provide items or resources
- Present risk/reward tradeoffs

## Strategy Element
Players must weigh their choices carefully since:
- No backtracking allowed
- Resources/health are limited
- Door choices may have visual hints or be completely unknown
- Cumulative effects matter for survival
