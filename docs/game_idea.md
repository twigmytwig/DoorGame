# Game Idea

## Core Rule
No art, only ASCII.

## Concept
A door-choosing game where you progress through rooms by selecting doors. Once you enter a room, there's no going back—only forward.

## Gameplay Loop
1. Player enters a room
2. Room presents multiple doors to choose from
3. Player picks a door
4. New room grants a benefit or inflicts a penalty
5. Repeat

## Room Effects
Rooms can:
- Grant buffs (health, power, speed, etc.)
- Deal damage or apply debuffs
- Provide items or resources
- Present risk/reward tradeoffs

## Strategy Element
Players must weigh their choices carefully since:
- No backtracking allowed
- Resources/health are limited
- Door choices may have visual hints or be completely unknown
- Cumulative effects matter for survival

## Door Bosses
Undertale-inspired boss encounters where:
- Doors attack the player directly
- Player must dodge incoming door projectiles/patterns
- Survival-based combat (dodge, don't attack)
- ASCII patterns flying at the player

## Keys and Locked Doors
- Some doors are locked and require keys to open
- Keys found in certain rooms or as rewards
- Locked doors may hide better rewards (risk/reward)
- Creates resource management decisions (use key now or save it?)

## Audio
- Each door has a unique creaking sound when opened
- Different door types have distinct creaking voices/personalities
